# text-to-beat
Converts a sentence into a drum beat.

I built this program in the spring of 2019 with one of my friends Joshua Mbogo to understand the management and employment of databases.

First, the program converts each word into the International Phonetic Alphabet through a downloaded library.  The words are then split into syllables through a multitude of conditions which for the most part separate groups of vowels surrounded by consonants or breaks.  The program currently plays different drum sounds in a sequence based on the beginning and end of the syllables, and attempts to play them in a cadence that matches speaking patterns by taking note of stressed and unstressed syllables.  The variety of drum sounds available needs expanding, and the process to determine the played drum sound could be improved.
