# text-to-beat

I built this program in the spring of 2019 with the assitance of one of my friends Joshua Mbogo to both create a cool audio toy and as an introduction the management and usage of files with JavaScript.  

First, the program converts each word into the International Phonetic Alphabet through a downloaded library.  The words are then split into syllables through a multitude of conditions which for the most part separate groups of vowels surrounded by consonants or breaks.  The program currently plays different drum sounds in a sequence based on the attributes of each syllable, attempting to play them in a cadence that matches speaking patterns by taking note of stressed and unstressed syllables.  

Possible improvements: Increased drum-hit variety and improved cadence.
